# SSOP (Safe & Secure Owner Password)

# Content of the repository

## ssop

The main platform where registration and authentication process occurs.

## envio_moviles

envio_moviles is a webapp to send SMS. It's a standalone platform to send SMS to the SSOP's users to authenticate them during the login
process, so it will be integrated in the SSOP workflow. 

It manages SMS sending to the users. We are using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) library that permits send
free SMS to registered destinations (phone numbers). It's fully useful to make a use case with some of our phone numbers.

## supermercado

supermercado is a online commerce website that we use to run a demo during the final presentation.

It has not been developed during this hackathon. It's a previous development from one of us (@miguelangelcw). During the hackathon we will
make some updates to connect this website with SSOP platform to create the use case.
